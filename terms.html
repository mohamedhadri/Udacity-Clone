                    <p>If you access prepaid, gift, promotional, scholarship, or sponsored subscription products or services for any Nanodegree Program or other Udacity prepaid or third party paid subscriptions ("Sponsored Services"), the Payment Method will be authorized for the number of months of the service noted in the product description for the payment amount indicated. Services may then be activated by the eligible User by enrolling with us or through other means contractually executed with Udacity.</p>

                    <p>Sponsored Services for any Nanodegree Program must be activated by the eligible User by enrolling with us within time-frame indicated, if any, in the applicable Scholarship terms and conditions found at https://www.udacity.com/legal, and the User must accept our Terms of Use upon enrollment. In addition, an enrolled user may disenroll or terminate and in such cases any refund will go to the original purchaser subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement between that purchaser and Udacity. Refunds processed will go only to the original purchaser of the Sponsored Services and, in no case, will any refund be paid out to the User or recipient. You or any User receiving Sponsored Services may not access free trial periods or subscriptions for Sponsored Services shall be unavailable for Sponsored Services purchases. Certain Nanodegree programs and promotions may also be excluded from the Sponsored Services program. Sponsored Services shall be solely for access for the period noted in the purchase documentation, purchase is solely for that Nanodegree program noted in the purchase documentation, and may not be credited for any other Nanodegree program. In the event that Udacity exercises its sole right to modify or update this Terms of Use with respect to activation and enrollment limitations for Sponsored Services and/or discontinue one or more of the Sponsored Services program in accordance with the terms established with the applicable sponsor of the applicable Sponsored Services.</p>
